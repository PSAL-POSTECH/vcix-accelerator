# tpu

A TPU's units on the two custom opcodes: one model (`libtpu.so`, name `tpu`).
The timing face is three unit classes; each lists its own encodings, `tpu.cc`
owns all of them and hands each call to the unit that owns the instruction.
The functional face is `functional.hpp`: what each instruction does to the
registers and to memory, which `execute` hands every instruction to.

## Units

| Unit | File | Instructions | Timing |
|---|---|---|---|
| `tpu::Sfu` | `sfu.hpp` | `verf`, `vtanh`, `vsin`, `vcos`, `vlog`, `vatan`, `vexp` (`sf.vc.v.iv`, custom-2) | a pipeline: one instruction enters per cycle, the result is ready `tpu_sfu_latency_cycles` after it entered, and any number are inside at once |
| `tpu::Misc` | `misc.hpp` | `vlane_idx`, `compute`, the cross-lane unit's `xlu_push`, `xlu_push_pattern` and `xlu_pop` (custom-2); the DMA's `dma_config_desc`, `mvin`, `mvin2`, `mvin3`, `mvout` (custom-1) | one cycle each, any number in a cycle |
| `tpu::Systolic` | `systolic.hpp` | the systolic array's input push (`sf.vc.iv` 0), weight push (`sf.vc.iv` 1) and pop (`sf.vc.v.i` 2) (custom-2) | one instruction per cycle. A push of `vl` elements waits for room in the input queue; one element a cycle enters a delay line of 2 x `vpu_num_lanes` - 1 slots and comes out into the output queue; a pop of `vl` waits until the output queue holds `vl`. A weight push changes nothing. The array stops while the output queue is full |

The systolic array's `compute` has no timing effect and is owned by
`tpu::Misc`. The cross-lane unit and the DMA have no model of their own
either: `tpu::Misc` owns their instructions at one cycle each. Nothing on
custom-3 is owned.

A unit is a plain copyable class with the methods of the timing face
(`owns`, `configure`, `can_accept`, `issue`, `commit`, `tick`) and a static
`encodings()`, the named encodings `owns` is answered from. `tpu::Sfu` and
`tpu::Systolic` change state at `issue`; the array also moves in `tick`.

## The functional face

`tpu::Functional` does what the Spike these units came from did
(riscv-isa-sim branch `spike-fp8`, 7259e73, the units built in; the DMA as of
9f555b4, without the element type that branch added to the descriptor), in
every lane:

| Instructions | What they do |
|---|---|
| `verf`, `vtanh`, `vsin`, `vcos`, `vlog`, `vatan`, `vexp` | `vd[i] = f(vs2[i])` on halves and singles, and on doubles for `vlog` and `vatan` |
| `vlane_idx` | every element of `vd` is its lane's number, written as 64 bits whatever the element width |
| systolic weight push, input push, pop; `compute` | a weight push adds a column to the matrix, of which a lane keeps its last `lanes` weights; an input push multiplies at once, element `i` of every lane being one input vector; a pop takes the results; `compute` does nothing. Elements are singles, halves or 8 bits wide; what 8 bits are rides the instruction in its rs1 field: 1 an E4M3 float, 2 an E5M2 float, anything else an integer. A pop to halves or to 8-bit floats rounds by `frm`, which the model reads through the host |
| `xlu_push`, `xlu_push_pattern`, `xlu_pop` | a tile of raw 32-bit values is pushed; the first pop after a push moves it across the lanes as the field at 19:15 of the push says ([4:3] the lanes shuffled before, [2] depth and lane exchanged, [1:0] the lanes shuffled after). A shuffle is none (0), every lane reading lane 0 (1), or every lane reading the lane a pattern names (2). The pattern of the shuffle before comes with `xlu_push_pattern`; the one of the shuffle after is loaded by an `xlu_push` whose [4:3] is 3 |
| `dma_config_desc`, `mvin`, `mvin2`, `mvin3`, `mvout` | a tensor of up to four dimensions between memory and the scratchpad, as the descriptor says: a mask, skip axes, a fill value, a bound on memory, an accumulating `mvout`, indices |

It finds an instruction by the names the units give their encodings, so an
encoding is still stated once. Its state (the matrix and queues of the array,
the tile of the cross-lane unit, the descriptor's address) is in its members,
and is not touched by the timing face.

Where the old Spike trapped, asserted or read past a buffer, the model ends
the run with a line on standard error (`tpu: ...`, exit 1): a special function
on a width it has no form for, a pop of more than was computed, an input push
before any weight, a descriptor with a dimension of 0 or one that reaches past
its tensor. As before, a transfer past the end of a lane's scratchpad ends the
run with exit 200, and a cross-lane shuffle whose pattern is not as wide as
its tile with exit 201.

Not carried over: what the old Spike printed under `SPIKE_DEBUG` and
`SPIKE_XLU_DEBUG`, and the list of all-zero tiles it wrote under
`SPIKE_DUMP_SPARSE_TILE`. A special function rounds its halves to nearest
even; the old Spike used the rounding mode the last floating-point instruction
left.

`tests/tpu/functional/run.sh` checks it on Spike: each program prints what its
instructions left, and the checksums in `from-old-spike.sha256` are of what the
old Spike printed for the same program. Given an old Spike as a fourth
argument it also runs it and compares the outputs byte by byte.

## Keys read from the machine description

| Key | Default | Meaning |
|---|---|---|
| `tpu_sfu_latency_cycles` | 10 | cycles from the issue of a special function to its result; at least 1 |
| `tpu_trace` | 0 | not 0: the model prints a line at every issue and every commit |
| `vpu_num_lanes` | 128 | width and height of the systolic array; 1 to 2^20 |
| `tpu_systolic_queue_entries` | 256 | entries in the array's input queue and in its output queue; at least 1 |
| `vpu_spad_size_kb_per_lane` | none | the scratchpad of one lane, which the DMA lays a tensor out over; a transfer without it ends the run |
| `vpu_spad_base_vaddr` | 0xD0000000 | where the scratchpad starts, written `0x...` |
| `run_base_path` | none | not in the file: Spike's `--base-path`. An indirect transfer writes the indices it read to `<path>/indirect_access/indirect_index<n>.raw` |

With `tpu_trace` the model reports, on gem5:

```
[tpu] issue vexp: the first
[tpu] issue vtanh: 10 cycles after the last issue, 0 in flight
[tpu] commit vtanh: 10 cycles after its issue
[tpu] issue systolic pop: 11 cycles after the last issue, 0 in flight, input queue 0, output queue 4
```

"In flight" counts the instructions issued and not committed. The issue of a
systolic instruction also reports the entries it found in the array's input
queue and output queue. The reports do not change what the model answers.
`tests/tpu/run.sh` checks the timing of the three units with them, all on
`libtpu.so`.

## The gem5 machine

`gem5/` is the machine these units sit in: the CPU and memory configuration
PyTorchSim measures its cycle binaries on, moved here from
`gem5_script/vpu_config.py` (the functional unit pool and the CPU `RiscvVPU`)
and `gem5_script/script_systolic.py` (the syscall-emulation script) of
`PSAL-POSTECH/PyTorchSim` 4b2555a, and ported to the gem5 of branch `vcix`.
The CPU's widths and limits, the pool's unit counts and latencies, the clock
domains, the instruction cache, the bus and the memory are the original's.

```
gem5.opt -d m5out examples/tpu/gem5/script_systolic.py -c <binary> --model libtpu.so \
    [--machine-config machine.yml] [--vlane N] [--vlen N]
```

| Option | Meaning |
|---|---|
| `-c`, `--cmd` | the program; `-o`, `--options` its arguments |
| `--model` | the model library, `libtpu.so`; required |
| `--machine-config` | the machine description (the PyTorchSim config file, as for Spike): every key of it goes to the model, read as `examples/gem5_se.py` reads it |
| `--vlane` | `vpu_num_lanes` for the model. Given, it replaces the key of the machine description; not given, the description's value holds, and without either the model's default, 128 |
| `--vlen` | VLEN of the CPU, 256 by default; the description's `vpu_vector_length_bits` is not read |
| `--cpu`, `--mem`, `--sparse` | accepted as before; `--cpu` is `RiscvVPU` by default, the other two were and are read by nothing |

PyTorchSim reads `system.cpu.numCycles` of every statistics dump in
`m5out/stats.txt` but the last.

What the port changed:

1. **The accelerator units are one `MinorVcixAccelFU`.** `SystolicArray`
   (`CustomMatMul*`) and `SpecialFunctionUnit` (`CustomV*`, 10 cycles) are
   gone, and `CustomVlaneIdx` left `MinorVecMisc`: this gem5 has none of those
   op classes, and the one unit, in the place `SystolicArray` had in the pool,
   hands their instructions to the model. So do the cross-lane units the fork
   `student-Jungmin/PyTorchSim` (`develop-npu`, 84fec6e) has in this pool
   (`TransposeUnit`, `CrossbarUnit` and their pops, or `CrossLaneUnit`): what a
   cross-lane instruction costs is the model's to say. `SparseAccelerator`,
   which no pool used, is gone with its op classes.
2. **The model is configured from the machine description**, by `--model`,
   `--machine-config` and `--vlane` above, in place of
   `SystolicArray.systolicArrayWidth` and `systolicArrayHeight`.
3. **Op classes gem5 25.1 added have a unit of their kind:**

   | Unit | Added |
   |---|---|
   | `MinorFPUnit` | `Bf16Cvt` |
   | `MinorVecAdder` | `SimdBf16Add`, `SimdBf16Cmp` |
   | `MinorVecMultiplier` | `SimdDotProd`, `SimdBf16Mult`, `SimdBf16MultAcc`, `SimdBf16MatMultAcc`, `SimdBf16DotProd` |
   | `MinorVecMisc` | `SimdBf16Cvt` |
   | `MinorVecLdStore` | `SimdUnitStrideSegmentedFaultOnlyFirstLoad`, `SimdStrideSegmentedLoad`, `SimdStrideSegmentedStore` |
   | `MinorCustomMiscFU` | `System`, which gem5's `MinorDefaultMiscFU` now lists where it listed `IprAccess` |

   Not placed: `SimdSha3`, `SimdSm4e` and `SimdCrc`. The pool has no unit of
   their kind: the original gives none to `SimdAes`, `SimdAesMix`, the six
   `SimdSha*` classes before them, or to `Matrix`, `MatrixMov` and `MatrixOP`,
   and that is kept. gem5 warns of each of the fourteen when the CPU is built;
   no RISC-V instruction of this gem5 has one of them.
4. **What this gem5 does not take as written:** `vpu_config` is imported from
   beside the script, not from `$TORCHSIM_DIR/gem5_script`, and the parameters
   `unitType`, `systolicArrayWidth` and `systolicArrayHeight` of a unit do not
   exist. Everything else is accepted unchanged, `SpmXBar` included. The
   branch predictor is gem5's default, as before; that default is now a
   `BranchPredictor` around the same `TournamentBP`.

`tests/tpu/run.sh` runs `sfu.S` on this machine as well.
